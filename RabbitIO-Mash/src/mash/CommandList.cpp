PURPOSE\n\
\n\
RabbitMash is an efficient highly optimized implementation of Mash\n\
which can take full advantage of modern hardware including \n\
multi-threading, vectorization, and fast I/O.\n\
RabbitMash is a fast sequence distance estimator that uses the MinHash\n\
algorithm and is designed to work with genomes and metagenomes in the\n\
form of assemblies or reads. It is implemented in C++ and is\n\
